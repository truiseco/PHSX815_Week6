# PHSX815 Spring 2021 Week 6

## Monte Carlo Integration

This repository contains the following programs:
- `HW7/CoSim.x` : approximates the volume of the solid obtained by rotating
cos(x) on (-pi/2,pi/2) about the x axis, and, according to user input, outputs
the results and a few relevant performance stats or repeats many times and
visualizes the error scaling relative to samples per integral approximated. [C++]

### Requirements

In order to compile and run `CoSim.x` (by typing `make`), you
need the ROOT package installed (for visualization):
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) [C++]

### Usage

All of the executables can be called from the command line with the `-h` or
`--help` flag, which will print the options.
